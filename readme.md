# IMDb-CLI
[![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/qubyte/rubidium.svg)](https://github.com/danielv14/imdb-cli/releases)

This is a repo for a Node-CLI that scrapes IMDb for search results and it's primary purpose is to have a fast and easy way to get IMDb-ID's for movies and series.

## Usage
Clone the repo, install it globally with `npm install -g` and then type the following into a terminal
```
$ imdb
```
This will display the CLI-prompt where the user is asked to enter a search query. If search results are found the CLI will display it in table where titles, years and IMDb-ID's are displayed.
